### My interest
I'm interested in UI design and will be deepening my skills in the future. I'm starting to get in touch with the UX design field since it is closely related to UI. UX design is focused on anything that affects the user's journey to solve that problem, positive or negative, both on-screen and off. UI design is focused on how the product's surfaces look and function. I'm trying to improve my technical skills and gain more practical experience to be able to become a UI designer in the future. Besides that, I'm also interested in programming, but for me it's quite late to begin. Nevertheless, I will continue my learning journey in Java, Python, and C/C++ programming languages. I love reading books, camping, and exploring some adventurous activities. I'm always trying to grow and learn something new.
